# Isleep
Increasing prevalence of sleep disorders, growing awareness about ill effects of untreated sleep apnea, and surging usage of oral appliances.

The global sleep tech devices market generated almost $13 billion revenue in 2020, and it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 14.5% in the next 10 years. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, a large number of affected people suffered with sleep deprivation, as a result of health problems caused by the coronavirus, which in turn, affected the sales of these devices. 
Sales started to increase at a good pace after the lifting of lockdowns, in 2021, due to the emerging demand for telemedicine and teleconsultation, which leads to the increased growth of the market.

Prevalence of Sleep Disorders and Growing Awareness About Its Ill Effects Are Major Drivers.
The prevalence of sleep disorders, such as insomnia, has increased significantly across the globe, which in turn drives the sleep tech devices market. 
This can be affecting every aspect of life, including safety, relationships, school and work performance, thinking, mental health, and body weight, and also leading to the development of diabetes and heart diseases. 

According to the Philips Global Sleep Survey, in 2019, 62% of adults do not sleep properly, and 67% of adults report sleep disturbances at least once every night. Thus, this factor drives the demand for sleep tech devices.

Our objective is to improve sleep routine for adults working from home.
Majority of adult workers suffer disruption in their sleep routines due to prolonged working hours, which results in them facing difficulties in establishing work-life balance since the start of the Covid pandemic.
Our potential users are working adults aged 21 and above. Many struggle with balancing heavy work schedules while managing personal commitments, increasing the risk of burning out.
By addressing this need, we plan to grow our business by being a leader in a fast expanding market of workers who are demanding services to improve their sleep routines, productivity and quality of life.
Our primary research objective is to understand sleep patterns of adults working from home.
This is followed by our secondary objective to identify solutions to improve regular sleep routine so as to help our users to stay focused meeting their work and other personal commitments.

Our secondary research from global surveys have shown that Singapore respondents are getting the least sleep in the world (less than 8 hours daily), possibly due to increasing demands working from home.
Almost half of survey respondents in Singapore have less than 7 hours of sleep.  
Not surprisingly, deprivation of sleep have corresponded to increasing mental and physical health issues reported in Singapore.
We endeavour to instill user confidence by handling it thoroughly.

Problem statement

iSleep is developed to address a need for adults working from home to fall asleep easily without any problem.
However, the initial take-up rate was slow.
We suspect that potential users are concerned with data privacy and security.
Our hypothesis is that users may want assurance of data privacy and security on the platform.
Dedicated sections will therefore emphasis on actions taken to be PDPA-compliant and to secure and protect user data.
Test will be a dedicated policy on data privacy and security accessible(from the dashboard) with full disclosures of security actions taken.
